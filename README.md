# Backbone-Demo

#### A simple demonstration using Backbone.js

## About

Backbone-Demo is an open source project to demonstrate building a simple Backbone.js for the absolute beginner.

The application is built using only the basics.  To keep the demo simple only Views, Models, Collections and Events where used.  Router and Sync where intentionally omitted as advanced topics, that would be better served in a more intermediate demonstration.

## Libraries Used

- [Lo-Dash](https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash/) - A drop-in replacement for Underscore.js
- [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) - Gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - A fast, concise, library that simplifies how to traverse HTML documents, handle events, perform animations, and add AJAX.
- [jQuery-miniColors](https://github.com/claviska/jquery-miniColors/) - A small color selector
- [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) - Expressive, dynamic, robust CSS for node.js

## Where to go from here

Got the Backbone.js basics down and want to take a look at persisting your data on a server?

Got persistence down and want to take a look at real-time syncronization with sockets?
